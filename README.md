<h1>FifteenCoursework</h1>

Coursework based around calculating the number of combinations of a slide puzzle that contain consecutive numbers/rows/columns. Calcuation time compleity for a puzzle with n tiles was reduced to O(n) via the use of a mathematical formula to do most of the heavy lifting. This led to a very quick program able to handle large sizes of puzzle, and a large number of puzzles too.
